## Call for extended Abstracts


To foster the growth of an active community, we aim to involve both senior and junior researchers in our workshop. To curate an insightful and engaging program, we invite submissions of **extended abstracts** up to 2 pages in length for research across various stages: already published work, ongoing work not yet submitted elsewhere, and finished work that has not yet been published. The workshop will also allow authors of in-progress work to receive constructive feedback from the community to help refine their papers.

Topics of interest may include but are not limited to: 

- **Novel Methods and Models for Explainability:** Development of new algorithms, techniques, or models to explain IR systems.
- **Internal Analysis and Model Interpretability:** Novel techniques for analyzing the inner workings of IR systems, insights learned from analysis and interpretation.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluation of explanation quality, metrics for explainable systems.
- **Human-Centered Explainability:** Work focused on identifying, investigating, or integrating users' explainability needs in IR systems.
- **Practical Applications of Explainability:** Explainability in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, legal, finance, etc.), applications to personalized search/recommendation, bias mitigation and fairness.
- **Other:** Other topics not mentioned in this list but still pertaining to explainability in IR.

### Perspectives on the Challenges of Explainability in IR

In addition to "traditional" topics in explainability, we also open extended abstract submissions for *Perspectives on the Challenges of Explainability in IR*, which include but are not limited to the following topics:

- **Explainable IR in the Era of LLMs:** What challenges for explainability arise with the emergence of LLMs in the IR pipeline and how should we begin to solve them?
- **Defining and Evaluating Explainability:** How can we unify different notions and definitions of explainability and achieve consensus over what constitutes a "good" explanation?
- **Insights from Other Fields:** What takeaways or solutions from fields outside of IR can be used to advance XIR research?
- **Interdisciplinary XIR:** How do ethical concerns, regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR), and domain-specific constraints (e.g., health, legal, finance, etc.) affect explainability research?
